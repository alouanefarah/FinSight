Governance and Internal Control Charter

1. Preamble
This Governance and Internal Control Charter defines the reference framework governing the principles, structures, and governance mechanisms adopted by FinSight Bank to ensure sound, prudent, and transparent management of its activities.
This document is consistent with the requirements set by the Central Bank of Tunisia, particularly Circular No. 2013-21 on banking governance and Circular No. 2011-06 on the internal control framework. It reflects the Bank’s ongoing commitment to align its governance with international best practices while considering the specificities of its regulatory and operational environment.
The Charter applies to all entities, departments, branches, and subsidiaries of FinSight Bank, both in Tunisia and abroad. Its purpose is to define the distribution of roles and responsibilities between the governing bodies, specialized committees, General Management, and control functions to ensure overall coherence, effective independence, and continuous supervision of risks.

2. Objectives and General Principles
Corporate governance at FinSight Bank is based on the principles of transparency, accountability, and integrity. It aims to ensure controlled growth, the Bank’s financial soundness, and the protection of the interests of all stakeholders — clients, shareholders, employees, and regulators. The governance system defines strategic directions, sets risk appetite limits, ensures compliance with applicable regulations, and promotes sustainable performance.
The fundamental principles of governance revolve around four main pillars. First, transparency, through decision traceability, clarity of roles, and regular dissemination of relevant information to the appropriate bodies. Second, accountability, whereby each body is vested with clearly defined powers and held accountable before the Board of Directors. Third, independence, characterized by the separation of executive and control functions, ensuring the objectivity of decisions. Finally, ethics, as a cornerstone of FinSight Bank’s institutional culture, requires that all decisions be guided by integrity, loyalty, and regulatory compliance.

3. Governance Structure
The governance structure of FinSight Bank is based on a three-tier architecture: governing and supervisory bodies, specialized committees, and internal control functions. The Board of Directors serves as the highest authority for guidance and supervision. It defines the overall strategy, sets internal policies, approves budgets, and ensures that the Bank’s activities operate within the regulatory framework established by the Central Bank of Tunisia (BCT). General Management implements the strategy approved by the Board, manages daily operations, and ensures the effective execution of decisions.
Specialized committees provide advisory and enhanced oversight in specific areas such as risk, audit, compliance, and remuneration. Internal control functions ensure continuous and independent monitoring of procedural compliance, risk control, and the reliability of financial and prudential information. This three-level system ensures coherence, soundness, and responsiveness in governance.

4. Board of Directors
The Board of Directors of FinSight Bank is responsible for defining strategic orientations, supervising management, and overseeing overall performance. It ensures that the Bank has an effective internal control system, an adequate risk management framework, and a robust compliance policy. The Board also ensures adherence to accounting and prudential standards, the publication of reliable financial information, and alignment of internal practices with the regulatory requirements of the Central Bank.
The Board’s composition ensures a balance of expertise, independence, and diversity. It includes at least two independent directors, one representative of minority shareholders, and members with recognized experience in banking, finance, and law. Chaired by the President of the Board, the body meets regularly to review financial conditions, audit reports, credit and risk policies, and strategic projects. Each decision is recorded in minutes and closely monitored by the Board Secretariat.

5. Specialized Committees
To ensure effective and comprehensive governance, FinSight Bank has established several standing committees under the authority of the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee is responsible for examining the reliability of financial information, overseeing the internal control system, and coordinating internal and external audits. It ensures that risk management mechanisms are properly integrated into decision-making processes and that auditor recommendations are implemented within reasonable timeframes.
The Risk and Compliance Committee supervises the entire risk management framework — credit, market, operational, and reputational risks. It periodically reviews the risk mapping, examines reports from the Risk Management Department, and ensures compliance with internal policy limits. The Committee also monitors the implementation of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CFT) measures, in compliance with the requirements of the Tunisian Financial Analysis Commission (CTAF) and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).
Finally, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee evaluates the competence and independence of Board members, defines selection criteria for executives, and ensures alignment between remuneration policy and performance objectives while maintaining prudence in risk-taking.

6. Internal Control Framework
Internal control is a fundamental pillar of FinSight Bank’s governance. It ensures operational control, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and reliability of financial information. The framework is structured around three lines of defense: operational functions, control functions, and internal audit.
The first line of defense consists of operational units, responsible for the daily application of procedures and adherence to limits. The second line is provided by risk management and compliance functions, which identify, assess, and monitor inherent risks. Finally, the third line, represented by internal audit, provides independent assurance on the effectiveness of the overall framework. This system helps detect anomalies, prevent fraud, and secure banking operations.
The entire framework is coordinated by the Internal Control Department, reporting directly to General Management and the Audit Committee, ensuring its autonomy and functional independence.

7. Internal Audit Function
FinSight Bank’s Internal Audit performs an independent and objective mission to evaluate governance, risk management, and control processes. Its role is to assess the relevance and effectiveness of existing systems, issue recommendations, and monitor their implementation. It operates across all entities of the Group, ensuring that internal policies and procedures are applied consistently.
Internal Audit reports directly to the Audit Committee, to which it submits its findings. It has full access to all necessary information, systems, and staff for fulfilling its mission. Its work follows an annual plan approved by the Board of Directors and adheres to professional standards of the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) and BCT requirements. Each audit report is formally tracked until all corrective actions are implemented.

8. Compliance Function
The Compliance Function’s mission is to prevent, identify, and manage compliance risks that could affect the Bank, its clients, or its reputation. It ensures that all operations comply with applicable laws, regulations, circulars, and internal policies. Compliance covers areas such as anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing, data protection, conflict of interest prevention, and management of international financial sanctions.
The Compliance Function maintains a register of compliance incidents, organizes regular staff training, and issues a quarterly dashboard for General Management and the Risk Committee. Its operational independence is ensured through direct reporting to General Management and unrestricted access to the Board of Directors for critical matters.

9. Risk Governance
Risk governance relies on an integrated and preventive approach. FinSight Bank defines a risk appetite consistent with its strategy, financial capacity, and regulatory requirements. The risk mapping is reviewed annually and includes credit, market, operational, liquidity, reputational, and compliance risks. Tolerance limits are set by the Board of Directors upon the recommendation of the Risk Committee.
Risk management reports include key indicators such as classified loan ratios, market portfolio sensitivity, operational incident levels, and compliance with regulatory thresholds. These reports are consolidated by the Risk Management Department and submitted quarterly to the Risk Committee and the Board of Directors. The objective is to ensure continuous and proactive supervision, guaranteeing the Group’s financial stability and overall compliance.

10. Revision and Entry into Force
This Charter is a living document, regularly reviewed to adapt to regulatory changes, organizational structures, and best governance practices. It is updated at least every two years or immediately following any substantial change mandated by the Central Bank of Tunisia, the CTAF, or relevant international authorities.
The Charter enters into force on January 1, 2025, after formal approval by the Board of Directors of FinSight Bank. Its application is mandatory for all employees, subsidiaries, and partners of the Bank. Any breach of its provisions may result in disciplinary measures under internal regulations and, where applicable, notification to the competent authorities.
