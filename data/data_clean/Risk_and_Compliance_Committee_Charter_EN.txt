Risk and Compliance Committee Charter

1. Purpose and Mission
   The present Charter of the Risk and Compliance Committee defines the mission, composition, powers, and operating procedures of the Committee under the authority of the Board of Directors of FinSight Bank.
   This Committee constitutes a strategic governance body responsible for overseeing the effectiveness of the overall risk management, compliance, and internal control framework. Its creation and operation are based on the provisions of Central Bank of Tunisia Circular No. 2013-21 concerning the governance of credit institutions, and it aligns with the principles of independence, competence, and transparency recommended by international prudential supervision standards (Basel III).
   The Committee acts with full autonomy of analysis and proposal, ensuring a balance between controlled risk-taking and the preservation of FinSight Bank’s financial soundness, reputation, and regulatory compliance.

2. Objectives and Responsibilities
   The main mission of the Risk and Compliance Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in defining, implementing, and monitoring the overall framework for risk and compliance management.
   The Committee evaluates the coherence of the risk governance framework with the strategy approved by the Board and ensures that internal policies adequately cover all significant risks incurred by the Bank.
   Its responsibilities extend to the supervision of credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, compliance risk, and emerging risks related to cybersecurity and sustainability (ESG). It also oversees the implementation of recommendations issued by the Central Bank of Tunisia and internal or external audits.
   Key Areas and Responsibilities of the Committee:

* Global Risk: Review the consolidated risk mapping and validate the risk appetite level.
* Credit and Commitments: Monitor portfolio quality, provisioning, and sectoral concentrations.
* Market and Liquidity: Analyze market positions, compliance with internal limits, and stress testing.
* Compliance and AML-CFT: Verify the implementation of regulatory policies and compliance with international sanctions.
* Operational Risk: Assess major incidents, remediation plans, and business continuity.
* Cybersecurity and Data: Monitor security indicators and reports from the CISO and DPO.
  Thus, the Committee ensures a transversal and integrated vision of risk and compliance management across the FinSight group.

   Each meeting produces a detailed set of minutes recording the discussions, recommendations, and decisions made, signed by the Chair and the Secretary.
   The agenda is prepared by the Risk Management Department in coordination with General Management and sent to members at least ten days before the meeting.

6. Interaction with Other Committees
   The Risk and Compliance Committee works closely with the Audit Committee, the Governance Committee, and the Remuneration and Nomination Committee to ensure a consistent and holistic supervision framework.
   Relevant information is regularly exchanged to avoid duplication and ensure a consolidated view of risks at the Board level.
   In particular, the conclusions of the Risk Committee are integrated into the annual reports of the Audit Committee, thereby strengthening the internal control and governance loop.
   In case of major irregularity, the Committee may refer directly to the Chair of the Board of Directors or recommend the convening of an extraordinary meeting.

7. Independence, Ethics, and Confidentiality
   Committee members perform their duties with full independence and in the exclusive interest of FinSight Bank.
   They commit to uphold the principles of ethics, integrity, and confidentiality. No member may participate in any decision concerning them directly or indirectly.
   Information reviewed by the Committee is strictly confidential and may not be disclosed to third parties without prior authorization from the Board of Directors.
   Any breach of these principles may result in the immediate dismissal of the concerned member and potential disciplinary proceedings.

8. Evaluation and Continuous Improvement
   The Committee conducts an annual self-assessment of its effectiveness, the relevance of its work, and the quality of information received.
   This assessment follows a framework approved by the Board of Directors and may be supplemented by an external governance audit.
   The results give rise to a continuous improvement plan, including updates to this Charter, enhancement of member competencies, and adjustment of reporting processes.

9. Revision and Entry into Force
   This Charter is reviewed at least every two years, or immediately in the event of regulatory changes or institutional reorganization.
   Any modification must be submitted to the approval of the Board of Directors upon the proposal of the Risk and Compliance Committee.
   It enters into force on January 1, 2025, and its application is mandatory for all members and relevant departments.
