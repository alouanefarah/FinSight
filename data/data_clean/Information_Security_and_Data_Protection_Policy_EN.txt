Information Security and Data Protection Policy
Version 2025 – Confidential Internal Document

Preamble
This Information Security and Data Protection Policy defines the comprehensive framework adopted by FinSight Bank to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and traceability of the information it holds or processes.
Its purpose is to protect information systems and personal data from any form of alteration, loss, unauthorized access, or fraudulent use. The policy complies with Tunisian Law No. 2004-63 on personal data protection, the requirements of the National Authority for the Protection of Personal Data (INPDP), as well as the principles of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and international standards ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO 27701.
It constitutes a key pillar of FinSight Bank’s governance system, ensuring customer trust, regulatory compliance, and operational resilience in an ever-evolving digital environment.

1. Objectives and Scope
   The purpose of this policy is to protect FinSight Bank’s information assets — whether physical, digital, organizational, or human — from any risk of compromise.
   It defines the principles, responsibilities, and controls required to ensure rigorous management of data and information systems while respecting the rights of data subjects.
   Scope of application:
   • All information held or processed by the Bank, regardless of medium (digital, paper, audio, visual);
   • All employees, contractors, and partners with access to such information;
   • All systems, infrastructures, applications, and networks used within FinSight Bank’s activities.
   No processing of personal or confidential data may be conducted outside the rules established by this policy and its operational annexes.

2. Fundamental Security Principles
   FinSight Bank’s information security framework is based on four fundamental principles: confidentiality, integrity, availability, and traceability. These principles guide all technical and organizational actions to prevent incidents and ensure service continuity.
   Principle | Definition | Operational Objective
   Confidentiality | Information is accessible only to authorized individuals. | Prevent leaks or unauthorized disclosure.
   Integrity | Data must be accurate, complete, and protected against unauthorized alteration. | Ensure reliability and validity of information and transactions.
   Availability | Systems and information must remain accessible to authorized users as needed. | Guarantee business continuity during incidents.
   Traceability | Every significant action must be logged and verifiable. | Enable audit and event reconstruction.
   These principles apply across all departments and subsidiaries of the Bank.

3. Governance and Responsibilities
   Information security governance relies on a structured and hierarchical model ensuring strategic oversight and operational effectiveness.
   Actor | Role and Responsibilities
   Board of Directors | Validates the global security policy and ensures strategic oversight.
   Risk and Compliance Committee | Supervises major incidents and GDPR compliance programs.
   General Management | Holds ultimate responsibility for security and allocates necessary resources.
   Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) | Defines strategy, leads cybersecurity projects, and manages incidents.
   Data Protection Officer (DPO) | Ensures compliance with GDPR/INPDP, manages data subject rights, and handles regulatory notifications.
   Employees and Users | Comply with security rules, report incidents, and protect credentials.
   This governance model balances strategic supervision with operational responsiveness and ensures independence of control functions.

4. Information Classification and Management
   FinSight Bank classifies information according to sensitivity and criticality to adapt protection measures and access rights.
   Classification Level | Type of Information | Examples | Associated Security Measures
   Confidential – Strategic | Critical institutional information | Risk reports, strategic plans | Strong encryption, restricted access, regular audits
   Confidential – Client | Personal or financial identifiable data | KYC files, account statements | Data masking, secure storage, partial anonymization
   Internal – Restricted | Non-public operational data | Procedures, internal reports | Role-based access control, automatic backup
   Public | Information for external release | Press releases, public reports | Controlled publication by Communications Department
   All data creation, modification, dissemination, or deletion must follow a documented validation and traceability process.

5. Personal Data Protection
   FinSight Bank processes personal data lawfully, fairly, and transparently. Each processing activity is declared or notified to the INPDP in accordance with Tunisian law.
   Data collection is limited to what is strictly necessary, retained for a defined period, and secured according to its sensitivity level. Data subjects have the following rights:
   • Right of access to personal data;
   • Right to rectification of inaccurate data;
   • Right to object to processing under legal conditions;
   • Right to erasure and data portability, where applicable.
   Requests are managed by the DPO, who maintains records and ensures compliance with response deadlines.

6. Technical Security and Cybersecurity
   FinSight Bank applies a defense-in-depth strategy to protect systems from cyber threats and unauthorized access. Critical infrastructures are segmented, redundant, and protected by firewalls, antivirus, intrusion detection, and continuous monitoring (Security Operations Center – SOC).
   System access is controlled through strong authentication (MFA), centralized identity management, and automatic access revocation upon employee departure. Sensitive data in transit and at rest is systematically encrypted.
   A Security Incident Response Plan (SIRP) ensures rapid reaction, including detection, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned.
   Incident Type | Examples | Response Procedure
   External Cyberattack | Phishing, ransomware, DDoS | Activate SIRP, isolate network, notify CISO/DPO
   Data Breach | Unauthorized file disclosure | Impact analysis, report to INPDP within 72h
   Critical Outage | Server unavailability, database corruption | Activate BCP, restore from backups
   Internal Violation | Misuse of access by employee | Suspend access, initiate investigation, update permissions.

7. Awareness and Security Culture
   Security culture is a key component of FinSight Bank’s resilience. Employees must adopt responsible behavior and complete mandatory cybersecurity and data protection training organized by the IT Security and HR Departments.
   Training topics include password management, phishing prevention, and digital hygiene. Internal awareness campaigns, vulnerability assessments, and simulated attacks are regularly conducted to reinforce vigilance.
   Serious or repeated violations of security rules may lead to disciplinary measures under internal regulations.

8. Audits, Controls, and Continuous Improvement
   Information security is continuously monitored and audited. The IT Security Department performs quarterly technical reviews, and Internal Audit conducts annual evaluations of overall effectiveness.
   Audit results are submitted to the Risk Committee and followed by corrective action plans with defined deadlines. FinSight Bank applies the continuous improvement principle (PDCA – Plan, Do, Check, Act) to adapt to evolving threats and regulations.
   Major system or regulatory changes trigger a review of this policy.

9. Review and Entry into Force
   This policy is reviewed annually or following any major incident, regulatory inspection, or technological development. Updates are prepared jointly by the CISO, DPO, and General Management, then validated by the Risk and Compliance Committee.
   It enters into force on January 1, 2025, and is mandatory for all FinSight Bank staff, subsidiaries, and partners.
