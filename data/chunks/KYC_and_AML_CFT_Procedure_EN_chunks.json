    "text": "None\n1. Purpose and Regulatory Framework\n   This procedure defines the Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (AML-CFT) system implemented by FinSight Bank. Its purpose is to ensure full compliance of all Bank operations with national and international legal standards on the prevention of financial crimes, protection of the banking system, and preservation of institutional reputation.\n   The framework aligns with Tunisian Law No. 2016-48 on credit institutions and financial organizations, Law No. 2015-26 of August 7, 2015 on counter-terrorism and money laundering, and BCT Circular No. 2018-06 on minimum AML-CFT system requirements. It also reflects FATF Recommendations 10–21 regarding customer due diligence, ongoing business relationship monitoring, and suspicious transaction reporting.\n   This procedure applies to all products, services, and distribution channels of FinSight Bank, including digital platforms and majority-owned subsidiaries. Every individual or entity maintaining a business relationship with the Bank—clients, authorized representatives, beneficial owners, or partners—is subject to the KYC and AML-CFT framework.\n   FinSight Bank recognizes that a robust AML-CFT framework is essential to its governance and financial soundness. This document formalizes the vigilance, detection, and reporting principles applicable to all employees.",

The Board of Directors sets strategic priorities and allocates necessary resources. It validates policies, reviews periodic reports, and approves corrective action plans.\n   General Management ensures operational implementation and integration of vigilance measures throughout banking processes. The Compliance / AML-CFT Officer supervises daily operations, regulatory monitoring, alert analysis, and liaison with the Tunisian Financial Analysis Commission (CTAF). The Officer acts independently and reports directly to the Board when major alerts arise.\n   Regional AML-CFT coordinators ensure consistent implementation across territorial branches, proper information flow, and timely reviews. Internal Audit serves as the third line of defense, assessing the effectiveness of the framework and reporting findings to the Audit and Risk Committees.\n   All staff members, regardless of role, must actively contribute to AML-CFT prevention. Each employee must exercise constant vigilance and report anomalies or unusual behaviors using the internal reporting procedure. Non-compliance may result in disciplinary or legal sanctions.",

    "text": "None\n3. Client Identification and Verification (KYC)\n   Client identification is the first line of defense against illicit activities. No business relationship can begin without prior identification and verification of the client and ultimate beneficial owner.\n   Upon onboarding, relationship managers collect official identification documents, proof of address, professional and income details, and the purpose of the banking relationship. For legal entities, required documents include incorporation papers, commercial registration, ownership structure, and list of beneficial owners. Clients are questioned about the source of funds, nature of transactions, and counterparties.\n   Information is recorded in the FinSight Onboard system, which automatically screens against national and international sanctions lists (CTAF, UN, EU, OFAC). Positive matches trigger enhanced validation before account opening.\n   FinSight Bank applies three levels of due diligence:\n   • Simplified: low-risk clients (employees, stable income, local source);\n   • Standard: most clients;\n   • Enhanced: politically exposed persons (PEPs), non-residents, and high-risk sectors.\n   KYC data must be updated periodically or whenever significant changes occur (address, business, ownership, or transaction pattern). Any relationship lacking complete identification is suspended until compliance is achieved.",

    "text": "None\n4. Risk Classification and Assessment\n   FinSight Bank uses an internal risk model to segment clients into objectively defined categories. Assessment occurs at onboarding and is regularly updated.\n   The AML-CFT risk model considers client profile, activity nature, transaction volume and frequency, geographic fund origin, distribution channel, and operational complexity. Weighted coefficients determine the overall risk level.\n   Clients are classified as Low, Medium, or High Risk:\n   • Low: transparent domestic activity with stable flows;\n   • Medium: diversified or international activity requiring closer monitoring;\n   • High: PEPs, offshore entities, shell companies, or complex ownership chains.\n   The FinSight AML-Scoring® engine determines review frequency:\n   • Low risk – every 12 months;\n   • Medium risk – every 6 months;\n   • High risk – every 3 months.\n   Quarterly reports on client risk ratings are submitted to the Compliance Department and the Risk Committee.",

Transaction Monitoring\n   Transaction monitoring serves as the second line of AML-CFT defense, detecting atypical or disproportionate operations relative to the client profile.\n   FinSight Bank operates a real-time Transaction Monitoring module within its AML Suite. It analyzes all transactions (branch, digital, and interbank) daily using configurable thresholds, behavior-based scenarios, and alert indicators defined by Compliance.\n   Typical alerts include:\n   • Repeated low-value international transfers without economic justification;\n   • Successive cash deposits and rapid foreign transfers;\n   • Cross-movements between linked accounts without commercial rationale;\n   • Transit account use by newly incorporated companies;\n   • Transactions involving high-risk or sanctioned jurisdictions.\n   Alerts are reviewed within 48 hours by compliance analysts. Confirmed suspicious cases trigger a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) to CTAF within 24 hours. The AML-Suite logs all alerts, actions, and justifications for audit purposes. Performance metrics (alerts, STR ratio, resolution time) are reported monthly to General Management.",

FinSight Bank’s procedure ensures confidentiality, speed, and traceability.\n   When an anomaly is detected, the compliance analyst reviews it in light of the client’s KYC and transaction history. If explanations remain insufficient, the AML-CFT Officer must validate the report within 24 hours. Confirmed STRs are sent to the CTAF via a secure channel and archived in encrypted form.\n   No employee may inform clients of STRs, in compliance with non-disclosure laws. The Compliance Department maintains an internal STR register, updated quarterly and shared with the Audit Committee.",

Annual in-person sessions reinforce awareness, addressing local typologies and emerging trends from BCT and CTAF reports.\n   Training participation and performance are tracked via the FinSight HR Competency Management System.
