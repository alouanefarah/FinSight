Each credit decision must be supported by an objective analysis of repayment capacity, guarantee quality, and regulatory compliance. Loans are granted exclusively to identified clients, assessed according to the KYC (Know Your Customer) procedure, and with a stable and verifiable financial situation. Financial and behavioral analyses must be carried out using internal scoring tools, notably the FinSight Scoring® model, which integrates quantitative criteria (income, indebtedness, banking history) and qualitative factors (business sector, governance, payment behavior). No exception to granting rules may be made without the express approval of the Credit Risk Department or the Group Credit Committee.",
